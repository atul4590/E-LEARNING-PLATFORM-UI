# Description
This page serves as a central location where users can browse through a list of products, view them in a structured grid format, and get more detailed information upon selection of any product. It combines layout structuring, styling, interactivity, and user interface considerations to deliver an intuitive product browsing experience.

1. Grid View (Product Listing Page):
The grid view displays multiple products in a well-organized layout, typically using a grid or card-based structure. Each product entry in this layout includes key details such as:

Product Image

Product Name

Price

Short Description or Category

This view should allow users to easily compare different products and quickly scan the catalog. The cards should be responsive, meaning they adjust their size and positioning based on the screen size—offering an optimal experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Grid layout can be achieved using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid, with appropriate margins and padding for spacing.

You should apply consistent styling for card components, hover effects for interactivity, and ensure that clicking on a product redirects the user to its detailed view page. Add CSS transitions to enhance the feel of interactivity when hovering over or selecting a product.

2. Detailed View (Product Details Page):
The detailed view opens when a user clicks on a product from the grid. This view provides comprehensive information about the selected product. Typical elements include:

A large product image or image gallery

Full product name

Price

Extended description

Features or specifications

“Add to Cart” or “Buy Now” buttons

Availability or stock status

Use clear typography and layout sections to separate different types of content. CSS should be used to align content logically (e.g., placing images on one side and text on the other, using columns or cards). If possible, include UI components such as image carousels or zoom effects for images, which improve the user experience.

3. Functionality and User Interaction:
Task 4 also requires you to incorporate interactivity:

Implement click event handling using JavaScript or a front-end framework (if used).

Transition effects between views or pages.

Data rendering should ideally be dynamic—fetching product information from an external file or API to simulate a real-world scenario.

4. Code Modularity and Best Practices:
Ensure clean, modular code by separating HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic. Use reusable components for product cards, and apply class naming conventions (e.g., BEM) for maintainability. Accessibility considerations such as alt tags for images, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation should be observed.

5. Final Touches:
Make sure your product catalog is:

Visually appealing

Easy to navigate

Responsive across devices

Functionally interactive

Task 4 tests your ability to design both a high-level overview (grid) and an in-depth presentation (detail view), showcasing your proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UI/UX design principles.
